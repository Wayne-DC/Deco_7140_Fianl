                        "The Old West, often referred to as the Wild West,
                        encompasses the period after the Civil War, the rest of the 1800s,
                        and the early part of the 20th century up to 1912, when the last mainland states entered the
                        Union.
                        During this time, thousands of pioneers pushed their way westward in search of land, better
                        lives, gold and silver,
                        and sometimes, to escape the law. Geographically,
                        the “Old West” generally applies to those states west of the Mississippi River."

                            "American cowboys are inseparable from American cattle. Americans are descendants of
                            European
                            immigrants,
                            and American cattle are descendants of Europe.
                            In the 1860s, after the American Civil War,
                            the markets of major cities in the eastern United States were open to western ranchers,
                            and the ranchers immediately expanded their herd size to accommodate increasing demand.
                            The herds that were raised in the Texas and Southwestern ranches were concentrated in the
                            westernmost train terminal in the United States,
                            the train terminal in Abilene, Kansas, to transport cattle to Chicago. Waiting for the
                            eastern
                            region.
                            This directly led to the rapid development of the western cowboy profession.
                            Young men in the Midwest farms, British people seeking adventure,
                            young people in the East who want to leave their parents, formerly rebellious soldiers,
                            a few blacks who were former slaves, some Indians, and Mexicans from the border.
                            They are the original source of the group of western cowboys. Later it was called "the hero
                            on
                            horseback."

                        At the end of the 19th century, the transportation of the United States was increasingly
                        developed,
                        and the status of the cowboy gradually declined.
                        They have switched to other jobs, and fewer people want to become a cowboy.
                        Although in the 1920s, some places in the west still maintained a cowboy lifestyle,
                        the golden age of cowboys is gone forever. However, their endeavor and pioneering spirit have
                        always inspired people.
                        For many people in the world, Western Cowboy represents the meaning of a hero.

                        <p> American culture, cowboys can choose their destiny with heroic
                            characters
                            and distinct
                            personality characteristics.
                            The core spirit of the old west is no doubt this kind of characteristic. The cowboy shows
                            the
                            spirit of individualism,
                            and they are a typical representative of the westward movement. They are brave and lonely.
                            They are alone in the desolate western grassland, arrogant, thinking for themselves and
                            making
                            decisions for themselves.
                            It is the most full-fledged individualism.

                        <p>
                            The vast grassland and the tough journey make the cowboy cheerful characteristic and
                            optimistic
                            spirit.
                            They love to enjoy the bitterness and optimistically face the suffering in the journey.
                            Comparing with living in a comfortable zone without efforts,
                            they prefer to create a beautiful life by their own hands. Today, these cowboy spirits still
                            deeply affect modern people.
